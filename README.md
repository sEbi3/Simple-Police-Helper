# Simple Police Helper Menu [.Net]
The SimplePoliceHelper (SPH) is a simple menu with features to make the patrols easier. The menu is adding some options (see below). 
I'll work on the menu and add new stuff and options. However, you are also more then welcomed to write suggetions in the comments.
